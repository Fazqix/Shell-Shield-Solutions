# Shell Shield Solutions

ShellSheild is currently working on a security solution for non-profit and small-scale organizations.

ShellSheild is designed to provide easy-to-use universal security techniques for organizations to adopt and better protect their services and data. Often these companies do not have many resources or a large enough budget to implement an entire IT department for their business but instead seek out-sourced options.

ShellSheild includes three primary areas of focus:
- Web Security
- Network Security
- Communication Security

These items are most needed for smaller-scale organizations and address free tools for those who don't know what they don't know. They will have easy steps and walkthroughs for non-tech-savvy clients who wish to improve their security without prior knowledge while self-teaching themselves the how and why.
